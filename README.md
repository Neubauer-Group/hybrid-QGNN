# hybrid-QGNN

qgnn_main is the primary file that contains the hybrid QGNN. NaN weight values have been fixed, but the current training times are very long, so something is still wrong.

tools_main is mostly taken from the qtrkx-gnn-tracking code, with a few edits by me to remove the need for config files (since I am trying to get this model to run for one specific case).
